									<h3 style="color:#703f21;">Process</h3>
									<p>This project was created for a small eCommerce business owner who was expanding her business outside Etsy and to her own stand alone storefront.<br /><br />
									
									The biggest challenge I faced with this project was the data cleaning portion.  I thought the csv files that Etsy provides its sellers would be straightforward, complete, and easy to translate.  I could not have been more wrong.  They were rife with ambiguity in column names and searching online for assistance proved futile as Etsy provided no information on what each column represented.  It was also quickly apparently that Etsy did not provide all the fees and costs associated with each order<br /><br />
									
									The Orders csv file was my primary table with almost 15,000 rows of data, one line for each order placed between January 2016 and December 2021.  The Transactions table, which contained every single transaction event made on the buyer’s site was around 100,000 rows of data.  I slowly pulled the data from this table and merged it into my Orders table.<br /><br />
									
									In the Transactions table, the amount and fees column only calculated to the net cost column about 60% of the time when calculated across the rows and the column totals were nowhere close to equaling.  Listing and Order IDs were placed in the middle of strings of text and had to be pulled out and changed to integers so I could match the corresponding values to the correct IDs in the Orders table.<br /><br />
									
									Back in the Orders table, I performed Boolean tests against each column with a monetary value, filtering out the TRUE values, to determine how much my calculations were off and what columns were missing for everything to add up nicely.<br /><br />
									
									The seller offered a gift-wrapping service buyers could add to their order.  This was in the Transactions Table, but not listed in Orders, though it was being applied to the Order Total value.  I also found that Etsy applied a fee to this service, which the seller had not been aware of.  I recall a specific discussion asking if she charged $4 for gift wrapping.  She confirmed and then jokingly said, “I bet you’re going to tell me Etsy applies a fee to that too.”  Actually…<br /><br />
									
									There was a sales tax column, but a state tax column for buyers who had to pay state taxes on their orders was missing, yet that value had been calculated into the Order Total with no reference.<br /><br />
									
									The more I merged the Transactions table into the Orders table to complete the whole financial picture of this store, the worse I felt for sellers on Etsy.  It took me several hours over a handful of days to Boolean test each column, filter, VLOOKUP, perform another Boolean test, and verify correct calculations.  It felt like Etsy was purposely keeping seller’s financial data murky to prevent sellers from seeing the entire financial picture of each order placed.<br /><br />
									
									After that, learning how to do a calculated field for cohort analysis in Tableau was easy.  A thorough video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGT1qwh7FY" target="_blank">Kirill Eremenko</a> on YouTube was exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />
									
									I created the visualizations to help demonstrate what the data was showing to the owner and helped her brainstorm ideas on how to encourage her loyal customers to migrate over to her new storefront and greatly reduce fees she was paying to Etsy.<br /><br />
									
									She approved of me using this project in my portfolio.</p>
